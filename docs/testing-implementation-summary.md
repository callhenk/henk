```

### ✅ Test Helpers & Utilities (100%)
**Location:** `apps/web/lib/test/`

- `supabase-test-client.ts` - Supabase client for testing
- `factories.ts` - Test data factories
- `test-providers.tsx` - React testing providers
- `index.ts` - Exports all helpers

**Available Functions:**
- `createTestClient()` - Get Supabase client
- `createTestUser()` - Create authenticated user
- `createTestBusiness()` - Create test business
- `createTestContext()` - Create user + business + membership
- `createContact()`, `createCampaign()`, `createAgent()`, etc.

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (100%)
**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**7 Parallel Jobs:**
1. Code Quality (typecheck, lint, format)
2. Database Tests (pgTAP)
3. Unit Tests (with coverage)
4. Integration Tests (with coverage)
5. E2E Tests (Playwright)
6. Build Verification
7. Security Audit

**Not yet tested in actual CI environment** - needs a PR to verify

### ✅ Documentation (100%)
- `docs/QA_PLAN.md` - Complete 7-phase testing strategy
- `docs/TESTING_QUICKSTART.md` - How to use tests
- `docs/TESTING_KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - Known issues
- `docs/TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## ⚠️ Needs Schema Updates

### Integration Test Factories
**Issue:** Test factories use old column names that don't match current database schema

**Files Affected:**
- `apps/web/lib/test/factories.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/test/supabase-test-client.ts`

**Schema Mismatches Found:**
- `businesses.slug` → doesn't exist (needs `account_id` instead) ✅ FIXED
- `campaigns.goal` → column name changed
- `agents.system_prompt` → column name changed
- `contacts` - error message unclear (undefined)

**Fix Required:**
1. Generate fresh database types: `pnpm supabase:typegen`
2. Update factories to match current schema
3. Check actual column names in `apps/web/lib/database.types.ts`
4. Update all factory functions

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Vitest** - Fast, modern, works great with monorepo
2. **Testing Library** - Perfect for React component tests
3. **Test Helpers** - Factories make creating test data easy
4. **Seed Data** - Having comprehensive seed data helps
5. **Type Safety** - TypeScript caught many issues early

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Node Modules in Tests** - Fixed with better exclude patterns
2. **React Import Resolution** - Fixed by installing React at workspace root
3. **Supabase Resolution** - Fixed by installing @supabase/supabase-js at root
4. **Alias Configuration** - Added `~` and `@` aliases to vitest config
5. **JSX in Setup File** - Switched to simpler mocks

### Still To Solve
1. **Next.js Route Testing** - Complex, need different approach
2. **Schema Synchronization** - Factories need regular updates
3. **Integration Test Environment** - Need better Next.js server mocking

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**What You Can Do RIGHT NOW:**
```bash
# Write and run unit tests
pnpm test:unit:watch

# Write and run component tests
pnpm vitest run --watch

# Check coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

**58 tests passing** with solid infrastructure for adding hundreds more!

The foundation is solid. Just need to update factories to match current schema, then integration tests will work too.
