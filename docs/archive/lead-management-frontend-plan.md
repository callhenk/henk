# Lead Management Frontend Implementation Plan

Based on the database schema changes in migration `20250119000000_lead_campaign_relationships.sql`, here's the complete plan for frontend updates.

## Schema Changes Summary

### New Data Model
The schema has fundamentally changed the relationship between leads, lists, and campaigns:

**Old Model:**
- Leads belonged directly to campaigns (via `campaign_id`)
- Lead tracking data (attempts, status, pledged_amount) lived on `leads` table

**New Model:**
- **Leads** are campaign-independent (no `campaign_id`)
- **Lead Lists** (`lead_lists`) group leads and can be reused across campaigns
- **Campaign Lead Lists** (`campaign_lead_lists`) - Many-to-many join table linking lists to campaigns
- **Campaign Leads** (`campaign_leads`) - Tracks individual lead status/outcomes within specific campaigns

### New Tables

#### 1. `campaign_lead_lists`
Links lead lists to campaigns with campaign-specific configuration:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  campaign_id: string;
  lead_list_id: string;
  priority: number;                    // Processing order
  max_attempts_override: number | null; // Override campaign max_attempts
  filter_criteria: Json | null;
  total_leads: number;
  contacted_leads: number;
  successful_leads: number;
  is_active: boolean;
  assigned_at: string;
  assigned_by: string | null;
  completed_at: string | null;
}
```

#### 2. `campaign_leads`
Tracks individual leads within campaigns:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  campaign_id: string;
  lead_id: string;
  lead_list_id: string | null;  // Source list
  status: 'new' | 'queued' | 'calling' | 'contacted' | 'converted' | 'failed' | 'dnc';
  attempts: number;
  last_attempt_at: string | null;
  next_attempt_at: string | null;
  outcome: string | null;       // 'pledged', 'donated', 'declined', 'callback', etc.
  pledged_amount: number | null;
  donated_amount: number | null;
  notes: string | null;
  total_talk_time: number;      // seconds
  last_call_duration: number | null;
  added_at: string;
  contacted_at: string | null;
  converted_at: string | null;
}
```

### Modified Tables

#### `leads` table
**Removed columns:**
- `campaign_id` (now campaign-independent)
- `attempts` (moved to `campaign_leads`)
- `last_contact_date` (moved to `campaign_leads`)
- `pledged_amount` (moved to `campaign_leads`)
- `donated_amount` (moved to `campaign_leads`)

**Added columns:**
- `lead_score: number` (0-100)
- `quality_rating: 'hot' | 'warm' | 'cold' | 'unrated'`
- `last_activity_at: string | null`

#### `lead_lists` table
**Added columns:**
- `is_archived: boolean`
- `tags: Json` (array of strings)
- `metadata: Json`

#### `campaigns` table
**Added columns:**
- `business_id: string` (for multi-tenancy)
- `goal_metric: string | null` ('pledge_rate' | 'average_gift' | 'total_donations')
- `disclosure_line: string | null`
- `call_window_start: string | null` (time with timezone)
- `call_window_end: string | null`
- `audience_list_id: string | null` (deprecated - use `campaign_lead_lists`)
- `dedupe_by_phone: boolean`
- `exclude_dnc: boolean`
- `audience_contact_count: number`

## Frontend Changes Needed

### 1. Database Type Generation

**FIRST STEP:** Regenerate database types to include new tables and columns:

```bash
pnpm supabase:web:reset      # Apply migrations
pnpm supabase:web:typegen    # Generate types
```

This will update:
- `packages/supabase/src/database.types.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/database.types.ts`

### 2. Create New Hooks

#### A. Campaign Lead Lists Hooks
**File:** `packages/supabase/src/hooks/campaigns/use-campaign-lead-lists.ts`

```typescript
// Query hooks
export function useCampaignLeadLists(campaignId: string)
export function useCampaignLeadList(id: string)
export function useLeadListsForCampaign(campaignId: string) // with stats view

// File: use-campaign-lead-list-mutations.ts
export function useAssignLeadListToCampaign()
export function useRemoveLeadListFromCampaign()
export function useUpdateCampaignLeadListPriority()
export function useToggleCampaignLeadListStatus()
```

#### B. Campaign Leads Hooks
**File:** `packages/supabase/src/hooks/campaigns/use-campaign-leads.ts`

```typescript
// Query hooks
export function useCampaignLeads(campaignId: string, filters?)
export function useCampaignLead(id: string)
export function useCampaignLeadStats(campaignId: string)

// File: use-campaign-lead-mutations.ts
export function useUpdateCampaignLeadStatus()
export function useUpdateCampaignLeadOutcome()
export function useBulkUpdateCampaignLeads()
```

#### C. Updated Leads Hooks
**File:** `packages/supabase/src/hooks/leads/use-leads.ts` (update existing)

```typescript
// Update existing hooks to remove campaign_id references
// Add new fields: lead_score, quality_rating, last_activity_at

export interface LeadsFilters {
  quality_rating?: 'hot' | 'warm' | 'cold' | 'unrated';
  lead_score_min?: number;
  lead_score_max?: number;
  // ... existing filters
}

// File: use-lead-mutations.ts (update existing)
export function useUpdateLeadScore()
export function useUpdateLeadQuality()
```

#### D. Updated Lead Lists Hooks
**File:** `packages/supabase/src/hooks/leads/use-lead-lists.ts` (update existing)

```typescript
// Add new fields to queries: is_archived, tags, metadata

export interface LeadListsFilters {
  is_archived?: boolean;
  tags?: string[];
  // ... existing filters
}

// File: use-lead-list-mutations.ts (update existing)
export function useArchiveLeadList()
export function useUnarchiveLeadList()
export function useUpdateLeadListTags()
```

export async function addLeadListToCampaign(
  supabase: SupabaseClient,
  campaignId: string,
  leadListId: string,
  priority: number = 1
): Promise<string>

export async function createLeadListFromCSV(
  supabase: SupabaseClient,
  businessId: string,
  listName: string,
  leads: Array<LeadCSVRow>
): Promise<string>
```

#### B. Type Guards & Validators
**File:** `app/home/campaigns/_lib/types.ts` (UPDATE)

```typescript
export type CampaignLeadStatus = 'new' | 'queued' | 'calling' | 'contacted' | 'converted' | 'failed' | 'dnc';
export type CampaignLeadOutcome = 'pledged' | 'donated' | 'declined' | 'callback' | 'no_answer' | 'voicemail';
export type LeadQualityRating = 'hot' | 'warm' | 'cold' | 'unrated';
export type CampaignGoalMetric = 'pledge_rate' | 'average_gift' | 'total_donations';
```

### 8. Migration Considerations

#### A. Handle Existing UI State
- Any existing campaign detail pages showing leads need to switch from `leads` table to `campaign_leads` table
- Update all lead status references to use new status values
- Remove any code that tries to set `campaign_id` on leads

#### B. Backward Compatibility
- The migration automatically creates "Migrated Leads" lists for existing campaigns
- These should be handled gracefully in the UI
- Consider adding a badge or indicator for migrated lists

### 9. Views to Utilize

Use the new SQL views for better performance:

```typescript
// Instead of manual joins, use:
.from('campaign_lead_lists_with_stats')  // Pre-calculated stats
.from('lead_lists_with_campaigns')       // Lists with campaign associations
```

## API Patterns

### Adding a Lead List to Campaign

```typescript
const assignList = useAssignLeadListToCampaign();

await assignList.mutateAsync({
  campaignId: campaign.id,
  leadListId: list.id,
  priority: 1,
});

// This internally calls the SQL function `add_lead_list_to_campaign`
// which creates the association and imports all leads
```

### Creating Campaign with Lead Lists

```typescript
const createCampaign = useCreateCampaign();

// 1. Create campaign first
const campaign = await createCampaign.mutateAsync({
  name: 'Fall Fundraiser',
  // ... other fields
  dedupe_by_phone: true,
  exclude_dnc: true,
});

// 2. Assign selected lead lists
for (const selection of selectedLeadLists) {
  await addLeadListToCampaign(
    supabase,
    campaign.id,
    selection.lead_list_id,
    selection.priority
  );
}
```

### Fetching Campaign Leads with Source List

```typescript
const { data: campaignLeads } = useCampaignLeads(campaignId);

// Each campaign lead includes:
// - All lead data (from joins)
// - Campaign-specific status, attempts, outcome
// - Source list information (lead_list_id)
```

## Notes

1. **Campaign Independence:** Leads are now fully independent entities. They can exist without campaigns and be reused across multiple campaigns.

2. **Lead Lists are Reusable:** A single lead list can be assigned to multiple campaigns, each with its own priority and configuration.

3. **Per-Campaign Tracking:** All campaign-specific data (status, attempts, outcomes) is now tracked in `campaign_leads`, not on the `leads` table.

4. **Priority Processing:** The `priority` field on `campaign_lead_lists` allows campaigns to process lists in a specific order.

5. **Source Tracking:** Each lead in a campaign knows which list it came from via `lead_list_id` in `campaign_leads`.

6. **Database Functions:** Use the provided SQL functions (`add_lead_list_to_campaign`, `create_lead_list_from_csv`) instead of manual inserts for complex operations.
