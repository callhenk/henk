# Salesforce Integration - Admin Setup Guide

This guide is for administrators setting up the centralized Salesforce OAuth integration that all users will connect through.

## Overview

You only need to create **ONE** Salesforce Connected App for your entire application. All your users will authenticate through this single app to connect their individual Salesforce accounts.

## Why This Approach?

- **Seamless for users**: Users just click "Connect to Salesforce" and authorize - no setup required
- **Centralized management**: You control the OAuth credentials
- **Better security**: Credentials are managed server-side
- **Easier updates**: Make changes in one place

## Prerequisites

- A Salesforce account (Production or Developer Edition recommended)
- Administrative access to create Connected Apps
- Access to your application's server environment variables

---

## Step 1: Create the Salesforce Connected App

### 1.1 Access Salesforce Setup

1. Log into your Salesforce account at https://login.salesforce.com
2. Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right
3. Select **Setup**

### 1.2 Navigate to App Manager

1. In the Quick Find box (left sidebar), type "App Manager"
2. Click **App Manager** under Apps
3. Click **New Connected App** (top-right)

### 1.3 Configure Basic Information

**Basic Information:**
- **Connected App Name**: `Henk Integration` (or your app name)
- **API Name**: Auto-populated (e.g., `Henk_Integration`)
- **Contact Email**: Your admin email address
- **Description**: (Optional) "OAuth integration for connecting Salesforce accounts to Henk"

### 1.4 Enable OAuth Settings

1. ‚úÖ Check **Enable OAuth Settings**

2. **Callback URL**: Add your callback URLs for all environments:
   ```
   https://app.callhenk.com/api/integrations/salesforce/callback
   https://staging.callhenk.com/api/integrations/salesforce/callback
   ```

   > **Note**: Add one URL per line. Do NOT include localhost URLs in production.

3. **Selected OAuth Scopes**: Add these scopes:
   - ‚úÖ `Access the identity URL service (id, profile, email, address, phone)`
   - ‚úÖ `Access and manage your data (api)`
   - ‚úÖ `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`

   Click **Add** to move them to "Selected OAuth Scopes"

4. **Additional Settings**:
   - ‚úÖ **Require Secret for Web Server Flow** (recommended)
   - ‚úÖ **Require Secret for Refresh Token Flow**
   - ‚úÖ **Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow**

### 1.5 Save and Wait

1. Click **Save**
2. Click **Continue** on the confirmation page
3. ‚è∞ **Wait 2-10 minutes** for the Connected App to propagate

---

## Step 2: Get Your OAuth Credentials

### 2.1 View Consumer Key and Secret

1. You'll be on the Connected App detail page
2. Find the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section
3. Copy the **Consumer Key** - this is your `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID`
4. Click **Click to reveal** next to Consumer Secret
5. Copy the **Consumer Secret** - this is your `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep these credentials secure!** They should NEVER be committed to version control.

---

## Step 3: Configure Your Application

### 3.1 Set Environment Variables

Add these to your environment configuration:

**Production (`.env.production` or your hosting platform):**
```bash
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID=your_consumer_key_here
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
SALESFORCE_REDIRECT_URI=https://app.callhenk.com/api/integrations/salesforce/callback
```

**Staging:**
```bash
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID=your_consumer_key_here
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
SALESFORCE_REDIRECT_URI=https://staging.callhenk.com/api/integrations/salesforce/callback
```

### 3.2 Secure Your Credentials

**For cloud hosting (recommended):**
- Vercel: Add to Environment Variables in project settings
- AWS/Heroku: Use their secrets management
- Railway/Render: Add to environment variables

**Never:**
- ‚ùå Commit credentials to Git
- ‚ùå Share credentials in Slack/Email
- ‚ùå Store in plain text files

### 3.3 Deploy Your Application

1. Add the environment variables to your hosting platform
2. Deploy your application
3. Verify the variables are loaded (check server logs)

---

## Step 4: Test the Integration

### 4.1 Test User Flow

1. Log into your application with a test account
2. Navigate to **Integrations** page
3. Click **Connect** on the Salesforce integration
4. Click **Continue** ‚Üí **Connect to Salesforce**
5. You should be redirected to Salesforce
6. Approve the connection
7. You should be redirected back and see "Connected" status

### 4.2 Verify Data Storage

Check that the integration was saved:
```sql
SELECT * FROM integrations WHERE type = 'crm' AND name = 'Salesforce';
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Status: 'connected'
- ‚úÖ Tokens in credentials field
- ‚úÖ Instance URL in config

---

## Step 5: Ongoing Management

### Monitoring

**Check Connected App Usage:**
1. Salesforce Setup ‚Üí Identity ‚Üí OAuth and OpenID Connect Settings
2. Monitor active sessions and token usage

**Review Logs:**
- Monitor your application logs for OAuth errors
- Set up alerts for failed token refreshes

### Maintenance

**Rotate Credentials (Quarterly Recommended):**
1. In Salesforce Connected App, regenerate Consumer Secret
2. Update environment variables
3. Deploy updated configuration
4. Monitor for errors

**Update Scopes (If Needed):**
1. Edit the Connected App in Salesforce
2. Add/remove OAuth scopes
3. Users will need to re-authorize next time they connect

### Troubleshooting

**Users Can't Connect:**
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check Connected App is active (not disabled)
- Ensure callback URL exactly matches
- Wait 10 minutes after making Connected App changes

**Token Refresh Failures:**
- Check that refresh tokens are being stored
- Verify "Perform requests on your behalf at any time" scope is enabled
- Check Salesforce session settings (Setup ‚Üí Session Settings)

---

## Multi-Environment Setup

### Option 1: Single Connected App (Simpler)

Use one Connected App with multiple callback URLs:
- ‚úÖ Easier to manage
- ‚úÖ Fewer credentials to secure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Same scopes for all environments

### Option 2: Separate Connected Apps (More Secure)

Create separate Connected Apps for each environment:
- **Development Connected App**: Limited scopes, test data
- **Staging Connected App**: Production-like scopes
- **Production Connected App**: Full scopes

Benefits:
- üîí Better security isolation
- üß™ Test scope changes before production
- üìä Separate usage analytics

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS only** - Never use HTTP in production
2. **Rotate secrets regularly** - Every 90 days recommended
3. **Monitor token usage** - Set up alerts for unusual activity
4. **Limit scopes** - Only request what you need
5. **Enable IP restrictions** (Optional) - In Connected App settings
6. **Review user sessions** - Regularly audit connected users
7. **Implement token refresh** - Handle expired tokens gracefully

---

## What Your Users See

With this setup complete, your users will have a simple experience:

1. Navigate to Integrations page
2. Click "Connect" on Salesforce
3. Authorize the connection (one click)
4. Done! ‚úÖ

No setup, no API keys, no technical knowledge required.
