# Lead Management Feature - Engineering Communication Hub

**Project Lead**: Cyrus (Product Manager)
**Engineers**: Engineer 1 (Campaign & Lists), Engineer 2 (Leads Page & Bulk Ops), Engineer 3 (Edit & Filtering)
**Start Date**: October 18, 2024
**Target Completion**: October 28, 2024

---

## üéØ Project Goal
Create a seamless lead management system that allows users to:
1. Edit lead information inline or via modal
2. Select multiple leads for bulk operations
3. Organize leads into lists with drag-and-drop management
4. Perform batch actions (delete, export, tag, add to list)
5. Filter leads by quality rating, source, and custom criteria
6. Monitor real-time campaign queue and processing status

---

## üö® URGENT COORDINATION NEEDED - NEW COMPONENTS READY

### ‚úÖ Already Created Components (DO NOT RECREATE):
1. **EditLeadDialog** (`edit-lead-dialog.tsx`) - Full lead editing with tabs
2. **BulkActionsBar** (`bulk-actions-bar.tsx`) - Fixed bottom bar for bulk operations

### üì¶ Components Needing Integration:
These components are ready but need to be integrated into `leads-list.tsx`

---

## üîó Integration Points & API Contracts

### 1. Selected Leads State (Engineer 2 ‚Üí Others)
```typescript
// In leads-list.tsx
const [selectedLeads, setSelectedLeads] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [editingLead, setEditingLead] = useState<Lead | null>(null);

// Props to pass to BulkActionsBar
<BulkActionsBar
  selectedLeads={selectedLeads}
  onClearSelection={() => setSelectedLeads(new Set())}
  onAddToList={() => setShowBulkAddDialog(true)}
  onBulkDelete={handleBulkDelete}
  onExport={handleExport}
  onUpdateTags={handleBulkUpdateTags}
  onUpdatePreferences={handleBulkUpdatePreferences}
  onUpdateQualityRating={handleBulkUpdateQualityRating}
/>
```

### 2. Edit Dialog Integration (Engineer 1)
```typescript
// In leads-list.tsx
import { EditLeadDialog } from './edit-lead-dialog';

// In the actions dropdown, replace toast with:
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setEditingLead(lead)}>
  <Edit className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Edit
</DropdownMenuItem>

// Add dialog at bottom:
{editingLead && (
  <EditLeadDialog
    open={!!editingLead}
    onOpenChange={(open) => !open && setEditingLead(null)}
    lead={editingLead}
  />
)}
```

### 3. Checkbox Column (Engineer 2)
```typescript
// Add to TableHeader
<TableHead className="w-[50px]">
  <Checkbox
    checked={selectedLeads.size === leads.length && leads.length > 0}
    indeterminate={selectedLeads.size > 0 && selectedLeads.size < leads.length}
    onCheckedChange={handleSelectAll}
  />
</TableHead>

// Add to TableRow
<TableCell>
  <Checkbox
    checked={selectedLeads.has(lead.id)}
    onCheckedChange={(checked) => handleSelectLead(lead.id, checked)}
  />
</TableCell>
```

## üìä Current Sprint Status (Oct 18, 2024)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Project planning and task breakdown
- [x] Implementation guide created
- [x] Database schema reviewed
- [x] EditLeadDialog component created
- [x] BulkActionsBar component created
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Added "Manage Lists" button to leads page (was missing!)
- [x] Created LeadsPageSidebar component for list filtering
- [x] Database types updated with campaign_lead_lists and campaign_leads tables
- [x] Fixed RPC function types

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Engineer 1: Integrating EditLeadDialog into leads-list.tsx (UNBLOCKED - types fixed!)
- [ ] Engineer 2: Adding checkbox selection to leads table (partially done)
- [ ] Engineer 3: Can now integrate LeadsPageSidebar component

### üìã Upcoming
- [ ] Bulk add to list dialog
- [ ] Campaign queue visualization
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions setup
- [ ] Integrate sidebar into main leads page layout

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Avoiding Merge Conflicts

### Files With Multiple Engineers Working:
1. **`leads-list.tsx`** - ALL THREE engineers need to coordinate!
   - Engineer 1: Adding EditLeadDialog integration
   - Engineer 2: Adding checkbox column and selectedLeads state
   - Engineer 3: Adding filter state management

   **SOLUTION**: Engineer 2 should make changes first (checkbox infrastructure), then Engineer 1 and 3 can integrate on top.

### Coordination Order:
1. **FIRST**: Engineer 2 adds checkbox column and selection state
2. **SECOND**: Engineer 1 integrates EditLeadDialog
3. **THIRD**: Engineer 3 adds enhanced filtering
4. **PARALLEL OK**: List management and campaign features can proceed independently

---

## üîß Required Database Hooks to Create

### Engineer 2 Needs (in `packages/supabase/src/hooks/leads/`):
```typescript
// use-bulk-operations.ts
export function useBulkDeleteLeads();
export function useBulkUpdateLeadTags();
export function useBulkUpdateLeadQualityRating();
export function useBulkUpdateLeadPreferences();
export function useBulkAddLeadsToList();
```

### Engineer 1 Needs:
```typescript
// Update existing use-lead-mutations.ts to add:
export function useUpdateLead(); // For edit dialog
```

### Engineer 3 Needs:
```typescript
// Enhanced filtering in use-leads.ts
interface LeadsFilters {
  search?: string;
  source?: string[];
  quality_rating?: string[];
  tags?: string[];
  lead_score_min?: number;
  lead_score_max?: number;
  list_id?: string;
}
```

---

## üö® Current Blockers & Decisions Needed

### Open Questions:
1. **Dynamic Lists Update Frequency**: Should they update in real-time or on a schedule?
   - **Decision**: [Pending]

2. **Lead Deletion Behavior**: Should deleted leads be auto-removed from lists?
   - **Decision**: [Pending]

3. **Processing Rate Limits**: Max leads per minute for campaign processing?
   - **Decision**: [Pending]

### Technical Decisions Made:
- ‚úÖ Using @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop (lighter than react-beautiful-dnd)
- ‚úÖ Bulk operations will use database transactions for consistency
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates via Supabase channels

---

## üîß Shared Resources & Dependencies

### Both Engineers Need:
```typescript
// New hooks to create in packages/supabase/src/hooks/leads/
- useBulkAddToList()
- useLeadListMembers()
- useCampaignQueueStatus()
- useUpdateCampaignLeadListPriority()
```

### Database Functions Needed:
```sql
-- Engineer 1 needs this for queue processing
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_next_campaign_leads(
  p_campaign_id UUID,
  p_limit INT DEFAULT 10
) RETURNS TABLE(...)

-- Engineer 2 needs this for bulk operations
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION bulk_add_leads_to_list(
  p_lead_ids UUID[],
  p_list_id UUID
) RETURNS INT
```

---

## üìù Code Review Protocol

1. Create feature branches: `feature/campaign-list-management` and `feature/leads-bulk-operations`
2. Daily PR reviews at 4 PM
3. Merge to main only after both engineers approve
4. Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` before commits

---

## üêõ Bug Reports & Issues

### Found Issues:
1. **Issue #001**: [Oct 18] LeadListSelector shows wrong count after removal
   - **Status**: Investigating
   - **Assigned**: Engineer 1
   - **Fix**: Invalidate query cache after mutations

2. **Issue #002**: [Oct 18] Permission denied for function add_lead_list_to_campaign
   - **Status**: Fixed
   - **Assigned**: Engineer 1
   - **Fix**: Created migration `20251018151543_fix_add_lead_list_to_campaign_permissions.sql` that adds SECURITY DEFINER and GRANT EXECUTE permissions to the RPC function. The function now properly bypasses RLS when called by authenticated users.
   - **Root Cause**: Original function definition was missing SECURITY DEFINER flag and explicit GRANT statement

3. **Issue #003**: [Oct 18] Duplicate key error when re-adding removed lead list to campaign
   - **Status**: Fixed
   - **Assigned**: Engineer 1
   - **Fix**: Changed `useRemoveLeadListFromCampaign` hook from soft delete (setting `is_active = false`) to hard delete (`.delete()`). Also removed `.eq('is_active', true)` filter from `useCampaignLeadLists` query.
   - **Root Cause**: Soft delete kept the record in the database with unique constraint on (campaign_id, lead_list_id), preventing re-adding the same list
   - **File**: `packages/supabase/src/hooks/campaigns/use-campaign-lead-lists.ts`

4. **Issue #004**: [Date] Description
   - **Status**: New/In Progress/Fixed
   - **Assigned**: Engineer Name
   - **Fix**: Solution

---

## üí° Implementation Notes & Tips

### For Engineer 1:
- The `campaign_lead_lists` table already has priority field - use it!
- Real-time subscriptions pattern exists in `useBusinessContext()` - follow it
- Progress bars use the shadcn Progress component
- Don't forget to handle the empty state when no lists are assigned

### For Engineer 2:
- Checkbox component from shadcn/ui has built-in indeterminate state
- Use `Set<string>` for selectedLeads for O(1) lookups
- BulkActionsBar should be `position: fixed` at bottom
- Virtual scrolling not needed until 500+ rows (per performance testing)
